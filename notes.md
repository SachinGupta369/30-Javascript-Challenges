divide method "/"

4/2 = 2;
2/2 = 1;
5/2 = 2.5;

To Find Remainder we use modulus "%"
10 is Dividend and 3 is divisor 
10 % 3 remainder is 1

same goes to 10 is dividend and 2 is divisor
10 % 2 remainder is 0

# And Operator 
( True && "Execute" ) O/p will be "Execute"
( False &&  "Execute") o/p will be False

# OR Operator 
OR Operator is the operator in which anyone expression should be true to execute or else return False

(Expression 1 || Expression 2) // if expression 1 is true then expression2 don`t execute
(Expression 1 || Expression 2) // if expression 1 is false then expression2 will be execute

# Ternary Operator
Ternary Operator is a condition operator where ( Condition ? Express1 : Express2) if condition is true then Express1 will execute if condition is false then Express2 will be execute

(condition ? Express1 : Express2)
i.e. let result = (condition ? Express1 : Express2)
console.log(result)
